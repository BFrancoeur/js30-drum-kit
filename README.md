#topics to cover:

1. I tried doing this without watching the lesson first and it
   didn't take long for me to become bogged down trying to figure out
   how to get the buttons to work. Creating my own HTML and CSS was
   straightforward, but writing the JavaScript to play the sounds
   stopped me in my tracks. After an hour of trying to do this myself,
   I swallowed my pride and followed along in the course. To make that easier,
   I deleted my own HTML and CSS, replacing both with the files provided in
   this course.

1. Key events -- The use of keyboard keys for triggering a method.
   a. HTML <kbd> tag
   b. The use of a data attribute to bind a method to a keyboard key
1. addEventListener 'transitionend' -- what it is and how to use it
   a. Listens for the end of a CSS transform event
   b. Use it to remove the CSS 'playing' class animations from a key after the
   transform has executed
1. What I learned
   a. New HTML tag -- <kbd>
   b. JavaScript Audio object
   c. How to test each new function or method before writing a ton of code 1. This is important because I waste a lot of time trying to debug code
   after I've finished writing it 2. Testing and debugging as I work is a lot more efficient than trying to
   debug after the code is written 3. It's a lot easier to troubleshoot and resolve an issue with a new function
   rather than waiting until later when it's part of the codebase
   d. You don't know what you don't know 1. I couldn't possibly create this app without doing some research, which
   I felt was akin to 'cheating'. That clearly isn't the case when creating
   an app unlike anything I had done before. 2. Before diving right in, I need to do some research. It's ok to see how
   other developers created similar apps and learn from their code before
   trying to build a new kind of app myself. 3. Research is the opposite of cheating -- it speeds up the process of
   development. Research also has the benefit of discovering new ways of
   doing familiar things and can be a source of inspiration.
